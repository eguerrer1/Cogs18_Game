# Cogs18_Game
AlienBattle is an interactive 2 player turn based game, which allows players to chose their aliens and battle in different galaxies. This was created as a project for my Cogs 18 final.

In order to play you must download and open the files in the repo.
Then run alienBattle.py with all the other files and directories within reach.
